# **DataCamp**
### **Azmine Toushik Wasi**

---

### Notes, Code Exercises, Informations and Certificates of all the python, R, SQL, data-science, machine learning and other courses I have completed in DataCamp.

---

**For most of the courses, exercise and solutions are added.** But, I won't be adding them in all courses, to focus more on the concepts and knowledge. But, in this case, I'll add chapter notes.

---

***Disclaimer:** Most of these solutions are made to actually run in DataCamp's exercise environment. So, most of them will not run properly in your machine because DataCamp preloaded some data and fuctions in the exercises, and I don't have them added here.*
