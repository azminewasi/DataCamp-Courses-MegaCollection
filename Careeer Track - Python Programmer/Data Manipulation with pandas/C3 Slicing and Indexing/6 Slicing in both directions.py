Slicing in both directions
You've seen slicing DataFrames by rows and by columns, but since DataFrames are two-dimensional objects, it is often natural to slice both dimensions at once. That is, by passing two arguments to .loc[], you can subset by rows and columns in one go.

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_srt is indexed by country and city, has a sorted index, and is available.

Instructions

Use .loc[] slicing to subset rows from India, Hyderabad to Iraq, Baghdad.
Use .loc[] slicing to subset columns from date to avg_temp_c.
Slice in both directions at once from Hyderabad to Baghdad, and date to avg_temp_c.

# Subset rows from India, Hyderabad to Iraq, Baghdad
print(temperatures_srt.loc[("India", "Hyderabad"):("Iraq", "Baghdad")])

# Subset columns from date to avg_temp_c
print(temperatures_srt.loc[:, "date":"avg_temp_c"])

# Subset in both directions at once
print(temperatures_srt.loc[("India", "Hyderabad"):("Iraq", "Baghdad"), "date":"avg_temp_c"])
