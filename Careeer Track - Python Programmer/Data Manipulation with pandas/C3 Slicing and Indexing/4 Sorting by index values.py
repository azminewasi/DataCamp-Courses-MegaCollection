Sorting by index values
Previously, you changed the order of the rows in a DataFrame by calling .sort_values(). It's also useful to be able to sort by elements in the index. For this, you need to use .sort_index().

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_ind has a multi-level index of country and city, and is available.

Instructions
Sort temperatures_ind by the index values.
Sort temperatures_ind by the index values at the "city" level.
Sort temperatures_ind by ascending country then descending city.
'''

# Sort temperatures_ind by index values
print(temperatures_ind.sort_index())

# Sort temperatures_ind by index values at the city level
print(temperatures_ind.sort_index(level='city'))

# Sort temperatures_ind by country then descending city
print(temperatures_ind.sort_index(level=["country", "city"], ascending=[True, False]))
