"""How many hours elapsed around daylight saving?
Since our bike data takes place in the fall, you'll have to do something else to learn about the start of daylight savings time.

Let's look at March 12, 2017, in the Eastern United States, when Daylight Saving kicked in at 2 AM.

If you create a datetime for midnight that night, and add 6 hours to it, how much time will have elapsed?

Instructions 

You already have a datetime called start, set for March 12, 2017 at midnight, set to the timezone 'America/New_York'.

Add six hours to start and assign it to end. Look at the UTC offset for the two results."""
