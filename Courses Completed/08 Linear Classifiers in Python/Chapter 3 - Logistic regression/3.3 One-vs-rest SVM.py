One-vs-rest SVM
As motivation for the next and final chapter on support vector machines, we'll repeat the previous exercise with a non-linear SVM. Once again, the data is loaded into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test .

Instead of using LinearSVC, we'll now use scikit-learn's SVC object, which is a non-linear "kernel" SVM (much more on what this means in Chapter 4!). Again, your task is to create a plot of the binary classifier for class 1 vs. rest.

Instructions
100 XP
Fit an SVC called svm_class_1 to predict class 1 vs. other classes.
Plot this classifier.

# We'll use SVC instead of LinearSVC from now on

svm_class_1 = SVC()
svm_class_1.fit(X_train, y_train)
