Inspect your clustering
Let's now inspect the clustering you performed in the previous exercise!

A solution to the previous exercise has already run, so new_points is an array of points and labels is the array of their cluster labels.

Instructions
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Assign column 0 of new_points to xs, and column 1 of new_points to ys.
Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, specifying the c=labels keyword arguments to color the points by their cluster label. Also specify alpha=0.5.
Compute the coordinates of the centroids using the .cluster_centers_ attribute of model.
Assign column 0 of centroids to centroids_x, and column 1 of centroids to centroids_y.
Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y, using 'D' (a diamond) as a marker by specifying the marker parameter. Set the size of the markers to be 50 using s=50.

# Import pyplot

# Assign the columns of new_points: xs and ys
xs = new_points[:,0]
ys = new_points[:,1]

# Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, using labels to define the colors
plt.scatter(xs,ys,c=labels,alpha=0.5)

# Assign the cluster centers: centroids
centroids = model.cluster_centers_ attribute

# Assign the columns of centroids: centroids_x, centroids_y
centroids_x = centroids[:,0]
centroids_y = centroids[:,1]

# Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y
plt.scatter(centroids_x,centroids_y,s=50,marker="D")
plt.show()
